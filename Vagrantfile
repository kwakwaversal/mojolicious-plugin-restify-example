  # I develop using Windows and unsuccessfully tried using both SMB and rsync.

  # SMB worked fine but Mojolicious' morbo didn't pick up file changes
  # recursively. This meant folders had to be specifically watched, which was
  # not very not practical.
  #
  # I then tried rsync with 'vagrant auto-rsync' which worked fine, but it was
  # only one way (host to guest) and required me to have an extra windows CMD
  # window open which was cumbersome for dev work.
  #

  # fine for development work, but just means that any guests that you use have
  # virtualbox additions, namely vboxsf file type.
