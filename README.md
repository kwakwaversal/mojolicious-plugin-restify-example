# mojolicious-plugin-restify-example [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kwakwaversal/mojolicious-plugin-restify-example.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kwakwaversal/mojolicious-plugin-restify-example)
An example of using my Mojolicious::Plugin::Restify CPAN distribution.

# Description
This repository is offered up as an example of using the
[Mojolicious::Plugin::Restify](https://metacpan.org/pod/Mojolicious::Plugin::Restify)
CPAN distribution with [Mojolicious](https://metacpan.org/pod/Mojolicious). It's
also a good example (in my humble opinion) of how you should organise a
`Mojolicious` app.

# How to get it working
For experienced users you'll know what to do to get this working, but to make
this as useful as possible to those new to Perl or Mojolicious, I've also
included a `Vagrantfile`.

## Vagrant
After cloning this directory, run `vagrant up` to see it in action. That's it!
