# mojolicious-plugin-restify-example
An example of using my Mojolicious::Plugin::Restify CPAN distribution.

# Description
This repository is offered up as an example of using
[Mojolicious::Plugin::Restify](https://metacpan.org/pod/Mojolicious::Plugin::Restify)
CPAN distribution with [Mojolicious](https://metacpan.org/pod/Mojolicious). It's
also a good example (in my humble opinion) of how you should organise a
`Mojolicious` app.
